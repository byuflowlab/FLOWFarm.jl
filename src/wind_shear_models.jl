"""
    PowerLawWindShear(shear_exponent, ground_height)

Provides shear exponent and ground height to define wind shear curve.
Ground height may be tuned because the power law does not always hold near the ground.

# Arguments
- `shear_exponent::Float`: defines trajectory of wind shear
- `ground_height::Float`: height of the ground (typically zero)
- `shear_order::Bool`: when shear should be calculated. Can be "first", "last", or "none"

    adjust_for_wind_shear(locz, reference_velocity, reference_height, ground_height, model::PowerLawWindShear)

Uses provided velocity at a given height to estimate the velocity at
a different height due to wind shear. Ground height may be tuned because the power law does
not always hold near the ground.

# Arguments
- `locz::Float`: height of desired velocity
- `reference_velocity::Float`: known velocity at reference_height
- `reference_height::Float`: height of known velocity
- `ground_height::Float`: height of the ground (typically zero)
- `model::AbstractWindShearModel`: wind shear model to use for calculations
