# FLOWFarm.jl

**Summary:** Wind farm simulation tool for gradient-based optimization.

**Authors:** Jared J. Thomas, Andrew P.J. Stanley

## Features
- Compatible with ForwardDiff for gradiant-based optimization
- Swap out models without changing anything else in the simulation setup
- Smooth/continous model implementations
- Runs on a single core, across multiple cores (threaded), or on multiple machines (distributed).
- Designed so that new model implementations can be included by adding a single method
- Allows for Wake Expansion Continuation (WEC) as described [here](http://flowlab.groups.et.byu.net/preprints/Thomas2021.pdf)

## Installation

### Install FLOWFarm

```
julia
(v1.x) pkg> dev https://github.com/byuflowlab/FLOWFarm.jl.git
```

## Testing

To test FLOWFarm, run the following from the top directory:

```
julia
julia
]
activate .
test
```
